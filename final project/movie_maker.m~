%create movie from png images, I barrowed this code from online 


% Make an avi movie from a collection of PNG images in a folder.
% Specify the folder.
myFolder = '/Users/victoriamessuri/Desktop/Scott/6.837/final project/pngfolder';

% Get a directory listing.
filePattern = fullfile(myFolder, '*.PNG');
pngFiles = dir(filePattern);
% Open the video writer object.
writerObj = VideoWriter('matlab.avi');
% Go through image by image writing it out to the AVI file.
open(wri)
for frameNumber = 1 : length(pngFiles)
    % Construct the full filename.
    baseFileName = pngFiles(frameNumber).name;
    fullFileName = fullfile(myFolder, baseFileName);
    % Display image name in the command window.
    fprintf(1, 'Now reading %s\n', fullFileName);
    A = imread(fullFileName);
    %imshow(imageArray);  % Display image.
    %drawnow; % Force display to update immediately.
    % Write this frame out to the AVI file.
    writeVideo(writerObj, A);
end
% Close down the video writer object to finish the file.
close(writerObj);
