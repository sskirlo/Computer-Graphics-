to specs, as does normal, binormal and tangent generation. 

Mesh generation and normals should be correct for surfaces of revolution and 
generalized cylinders. 

We generated two new .swp files, chain.swp and link.swp (located in /swp). chain.swp defines a 
chain along a parabolic path, while link.swp is a single link of this chain. 
We used chain.m and dist.m to generate these .swp files. We have attached 
.pngs with the renderings of these objects.
