The code was compiled on athena. It has the standard controls. Pressing s toggles between skeleton and mesh modes
and moving the slidders translates and rotates the limbs. 

There is some problem with Model2, Model2 loads appropriately but immediately crashes when any limb is moved. This
occurs in both mesh mode and skeleton mode. This problem does not appear in Model1 and Model3. Perhaps there is some
issue with the formatting of the Model2 input files. The mesh and skeleton are both appropriately rendered in their
default state.
